         Generic Encapsulation of Messages for Bundle Protocol
                     draft-taylor-dtn-bp-gem-latest

Abstract

   As the availability of Bundle Protocol version 7 [!RFC9171] becomes
   more pervasive, there is increasing need to port existing network
   services designed for the terrestrial Internet to function correctly
   and efficiently over Bundle Protocol.  This document introduces 2
   modes: Tunnel mode, whereby opaque messages are encapsulated and
   forwarded from an ingress gateway, and decapsulated at an egress
   gateway, across a Bundle Protocol segment of the end to end path; and
   Transport mode, whereby application messages are delivered from host
   to host using the Bundle Protocol as the end-to-end message transport
   protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Bundle Protocol version 7 is fundamentally a message passing
   protocol.  Individual messages are encapsulated as the opaque payload
   of bundles, and the bundles are transported across the network using
   just the information in the bundle envelope.  This encapsulation is
   sufficiently general purpose that porting existing message-based
   applications to use the bundle protocol is reasonably simple, and
   there is sufficient commonality of required behaviour that general
   rules can be recommended.

   The encapsulation mechanism described address the following
   requirements:

   1.  The delivery of application messages across a network that
       features Bundle Protocol as part or all of the end-to-end path.

   2.  The delivery of messages that may have a relative sequential
       ordering.  I.e. message A must be delivered before message B,
       even if re-ordering occurs within the network.

   3.  The reliable delivery of some or all messages, such that an
       application designed to use a reliable transport layer can
       continue to hold the reliability assumption when operating over
       Bundle Protocol.

   This document provides mechanisms that are applicable to applications
   and services that exchange framed messages.  The mechanisms described
   are not suitable for byte-streaming applications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Generic encapsulation

3.1.  Abstract information fields

   In order to deliver a particular application specific message from
   source to destination, the following information fields must be
   known:

   *  MESSAGE_ID: The unique identifier of the message.  If two messages
      have the same identifier then the message content must be
      logically identical, such that either message may be discarded
      without breaking a higher-level message protocol.

   *  SOURCE_ID: The identity of the source of the message.

   *  DESTINATION_ID: The identity of the destination of the message.

   *  SEQUENCE_ID (optional): If messages have a temporal relationship,
      such that one message must be processed before another, the
      identity of the sequence.

   *  SEQUENCE_NUMBER (optional): If messages have a temporal
      relationship, such that one message must be processed before
      another, the order of the message within the sequence.

   *  ACK_REQUIRED (optional): If an explicit acknowledgement of the
      successful delivery of a message is required from the receiver.

   It may well be the case that some or all of these required
   information fields may be encoded in the application message format,
   or map directly to a field in the Bundle Protocol itself, but they
   are defined here in abstract terms in order to support the protocol
   specifications that follow.
